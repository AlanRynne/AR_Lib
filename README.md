## Objective

**AR_Lib** is *(or will be)* an independent and open source library for ***Architectural Geometry*** algorithms developed by myself.

The core idea is to create a complete package of 3D entities and functions that could be easily connected to different software solutions like:

* McNeel Rhinoceros/Grasshopper
* Autodesk Revit/Dynamo
* Autocad
* CLI
* NuGet Package
* Possibly others...

> I have also started developing a set of *Grasshopper components* that is also available online at:

## Usage

> This section will be written very shortly!

## Documentation

> I am working on creating a basic SDK website using DocFx. As soon as it is up and running it will be displayed in this section.

## Contributing

I haven't developed any contributing guidelines, although the `master` branch is *push protected* and is connected to Travis-CI so all contributions should pass build tests.

If you want to contribute to this library, feel free to fork this repo and create a pull request with any modifications.
